# BuddyBeam
BuddyBean is a full-stack site which takes in results from a user's survey, and compares their answers with other users. Based on this comparison, the site will display the name and picture of the user in the database who is the best overall match to the current user. 

## Dependencies

* Express.js
* Body-parser

## What I learned
I learned to use Node and Express with jquery. I learned to send GET and POST requests using Express. There are several different ways to use express to display information to a user. POST can be used to to send data to different types of databases. I learned to use a file structure which breaks the routes into smaller modules and these modules can be required in a central file.
